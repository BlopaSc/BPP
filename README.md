# BPP, B++ or Blopa++

Is a collection of C++ libraries and classes which can come in handy.

The repository is built and mantained by Blopa SC., it comes with no guarantees but feel free to use.

If you discover a bug, feel free to send me a message with your discovery; and/or if you patched it, please send a pull request to the repository.

## About me

I am just a programmer who likes building data structures and some other clever algorithms in his free time. I am trying to make the library as similar to STL as possible to allow the easy utilization of the library, but sometimes differences may occur.

I know these kind of projects should usually be worked with forks, but I will be commiting to the master branch a lot. This is my repository and I don't expect anyone else to be working on it. However, I will do my best to stick to a single class at a time.

## Installation and requirements

### Requirements

The only requirement for this library is that it is written using the C++20, therefore you will require and updated compiler to be able to compile the code. This also means you will need to add the following flag to your compiler:

~~~
-std=c++20
~~~

### Installation

This library doesn't requires any kind of installation, you can include the documents straight into your code, or if you are using a makefile you can handle compilation through the .h with the .cpp.

## Directories

- Collections: In here you will find all data-structures related classes and algorithms.
